                <h4>Dissolved oxygen (DO) is considered to be one of the most important
                    parameters of water quality in streams, rivers, and lakes. It is a key
                    test of water pollution. The higher the concentration of dissolved
                    oxygen, the better the water quality. Oxygen is slightly soluble in
                    water and very sensitive to temperature.
                    <br>
                    For example, the saturation
                    concentration at 20°C is about 9 mg/L and at 0°C is 14.6 mg/L Healthy
                    water should generally have dissolved oxygen concentrations above
                    6.5-8 mg/L and between about 80-120 %.

                    down into simpler compounds, such as CO2 and H2O, and the microbes use the
                    energy released for growth and reproduction. When this process occurs in
                    water, the oxygen consumed is the DO in the water. If oxygen is not
                    continuously replaced by natural or artificial means in the water, the DO
                    concentration will reduce as the microbes decompose the organic materials.
